to do from meeting on 20/12/19
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXISTING WORK ITEMS FOR PARALLEL VERSION
1. # mono FLAG for no of cores/threads used --> 
- see: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-runsafe?man=mono , https://www.mono-project.com/docs/debug+profile/profile/profiler/ 
- Like others have already said, you can run .NET applications on Mono. If your applications use Platform Invocation (P/Invoke) 
to call native code, you may run into some trouble if there is no Mono implementation of the native library. To check whether 
your application does that (or uses APIs that haven't been implemented in Mono yet),you can use the Mono Migration Analyzer (MoMA).
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/950360/how-to-run-c-sharp-project-under-linux)
- currently using: ‘nohup mono bin/Debug/Minimax_TPL.exe -MONO_THREADS_PER_CPU=4 > program.out’ --> not sure if this is the correct command?
EXISTING WORK ITEMS FOR PERFORMANCE
2. performance measuring
3. performance tuning

NEEDS APPROVAL AND VERFICATION  
1. valid result - check that parallel result is the same as sequential, hit all paths in tree 

OTHER
1. Download software needed on newly purchased quad-core laptop
2. VS Enterprise version licence --> look at parallel tools

COMPLETED WORK ITEMS
1. lock board (release when printing)
2. lower score for no build
3. timestamp elapsed time, timestamp for threads
4. revised timeplan
5. amount of work done in each thread
6. check strided iteration is as expected (no duplicated move - correctness) -->> noMoveHasBeenCheckedTwice() function (check 4 lists)
7. quad core windows 10 with 4 cores and 8 threads
8. more commenting
9. VS Enterprise version licence from Iain ---->> FTNPY-MC8RH-RJCH8-XFK77-QPG66
10. move breakdown diagram for board 1 between seq and parallel

USEFUL INFO
- which mcs /opt/mono/bin/mcs
- status of cores --> top, htop
- check performance --> in directory with source code --> xbuild --> mono bin/Debug/Minimax_TPL.exe

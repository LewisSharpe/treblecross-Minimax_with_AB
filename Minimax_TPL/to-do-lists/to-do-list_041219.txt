TO DO LIST - 04.12.19:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. print message who actually won; check this against expected result 
DONE
2. continue the validation and test boards that should have a win in 2, and a few larger 7x7
boards, which have a clear best move, i.e. something that you can check. 
DONE FOR 3X3, NEED TO TAKE THE PRINT STATEMENTS OUT FOR 7X7 - TAKING A LONG TIME
3. want to improve the static eval fct: EvalCurrentBoard() - 2 in a row are useless if you can't expand on either side. 
STILL EXISTING
4. 2 pieces with a gap in the middle, are almost as good as 2 in a row, because that could be a win in 1 move.
PARTIAL - NEEDS APPROVAL
5. if validation of these cases is ok, you can move on to the parallel version: enable the Parallel.Invoke
in ParSearchWrapper
STILL EXISTING
6. make sure you use locks when combining the results from the threads.
STILL EXISTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the current version is parallel-ready and shouldn't need a lot more changes.
